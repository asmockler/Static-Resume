					<p>To begin working as a driver, you must obtain a Salt Lake City Corporation Ground Transportation Driver Badge.

You will need 2 valid forms of I.D. for this appointment. Once your appointment is scheduled with the badging office, please contact us and let us know when your appointment is scheduled.</li>
				        <li>After you have scheduled your fingerprinting appointment, fill out the <a href="http://www.slcairport.com/badging/cmsdocuments/GT_Badge_App_Driver1.pdf" target="_blank">Ground Transportation Driver Badge Application</a>. Please, carefully fill out sections 1, 3, 4, and 5.</li>
				        <li>To finish, please make sure you have carefully read through and complete the final two steps listed on the Ground Transportation Drivers information page.</li>
