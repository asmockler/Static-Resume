						<h1>Our Drivers</h1>
						<p>At Shuttle Express, our commitment to the highest safety standards is evident in our driver screening and training procedures. Prior to hiring a potential driver, we verify the current validity of his or her Driver’s License. We ensure that the driver has undergone state-regulated training and evaluation, including expert knowledge of the vehicles he or she drives and a thorough understanding of safety procedures and defensive driving habits. The driver must have no negative points on his or her license, and must possess a valid Airport Driver Access Badge, ensuring clear background checks through the Department of Homeland Security.</p>
						<p>Shuttle Express maintains a strict zero tolerance policy on drug and alcohol abuse. All applicants for employment must undergo DOT-regulated drug and alcohol screening prior to any offer of employment. Once employed, all drivers are subject to ongoing random DOT-regulated drug and alcohol screening as long as they are employed with Shuttle Express.</p>
						<p>This rigorous approach has proven successful by our low turnover of employees, some of whom have been with us since the inception of our company. Shuttle Express has the utmost confidence that our professional drivers are the best in the Northern Utah Metropolitan Areas. World leaders, VIPs, international corporations, churches, schools, and families have trusted our drivers to get them where they need to go, and not a single passenger has ever been let down.</p>

						<h1>Terms of Service</h1>
						<p class="lead">All transportation provided by Park City Express and its affiliates ("Transport Utah") is subject to the following Terms of Service ("Terms").</p>
						<p><strong>LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY:</strong> Shuttle Express and its affiliates will not be responsible for delays caused by weather, road, or traffic conditions; mechanical failure; or any other conditions beyond our control. Any expenses arising as a result of delayed departure or arrival times, including missed flights or travel connections, are the sole responsibility of the passenger.</p>
						<p><strong>PAYMENTS:</strong> Some Shuttle Express services require prepayment with a credit card. Your credit card will be charged for the full amount at the time you make your reservation. Other reservations, as designated will be paid to the driver at the time of service.</p>
						<p><strong>REFUND POLICY:</strong> Individual reservation cancellations must be made 72 hours prior to your original pick-up time and are subject to a booking fee (listed on your receipt). Individual reservations that are NOT cancelled within the 72 hour advance cancellation time frame; and/or in cases where Reservation Abandonment (see below) occurs, will be billed the full amount of the trip as reserved.</p>
						<p><strong>RESERVATION ABANDONMENT:</strong> Reservation abandonment occurs when the Operator cannot find the customer at the designated pick-up location and cannot reach the customer for further instruction using the “Day of Travel” contact number provided within a short, reasonable time period, so as not to jeopardize pick-up of other customers.</p>
						<p><strong>ARRIVAL AT THE AIRPORT:</strong> Since we do not have a booth at the airport, please call us at (801) 231-9111 upon arrival and once you retrieve ALL your luggage. The airport requires our drivers to wait in a staging lot just outside the airport and once we receive the call, we send the driver in. The driver will pick up at Terminal 1 – SLIDING GLASS DOOR #5 for Lufthansa, JetBlue, Southwest, US Airways, American, Frontier and United; and at Terminal 2 – SLIDING GLASS DOOR 11 for Delta, right outside baggage claim on the ORANGE </p>
						<p><strong>PASSENGER SAFETY:</strong> The safety of our passengers is our highest priority. In order to maintain a safe and comfortable driving environment, our drivers have the right to deny or de-board any person who, in the driver’s judgement, is unruly, disruptive or poses a threat to the safety of the vehicle or anyone aboard. To ensure passenger safety and comply with Utah State Laws, all passengers are required to use safety belts while inside the vehicle, but it is the passenger’s responsibility to ensure the safety belt is securely fastened, as required by law.</p>
						<p><strong>PRIVACY:</strong> By using our Online Reservation System, you agree to the terms set forth herein, and as fully outlined at: http://shuttleexpressutah.com/tos/privacy-policy/. For purposes of our Privacy Policy, Personal information means any information you submit to us which personally identifies you and includes your name, address, telephone number(s), e-mail address, etc. Airport Express Shuttle only collects information when you submit it to us. It is Shuttle Express’s policy to keep this information as confidential and use it only for the purpose for which it was submitted or to improve our customers use of the Site and/or for marketing research. If you wish to be removed from our databases, you may Email us at: privacy@shuttleexpressutah.com and instruct us accordingly.</p>
						<p><strong>LUGGAGE RESTRICTIONS:</strong> For each passenger, at no extra cost, the following is accepted on board the vehicle:
							<ul>
								<li>2 Checked Luggage Pieces, such as standard suitcases and large duffel bags weighing 50 pounds or less each;</li>
								<li>2 Carry-On Items, such as purses, laptop cases, briefcases, small suitcases and backpacks.</li>
							</ul>
						</p>
						<p><strong>EXTRA LUGGAGE AND OVER-SIZED ITEMS:</strong> Vehicles have limited space. Items considered excessive are subject to a small fee. The fee is dependent on the item(s) in question and may vary by vehicle type and location.</p>
						<p><strong>LOST ITEMS:</strong> Passengers are responsible for their personal possessions. We try our best to return items left in our vehicles to their owners, but we assume no liability for lost, stolen, damaged or misplaced items. Any charges incurred in returning a left-behind item to its owner must be paid for by the owner. Many bags look alike. Our drivers cannot be responsible for remembering which bags belong to each passenger. Upon reaching your destination, please check to see that you have retrieved all your belongings, and that each bag, briefcase, computer, etc. is, indeed, yours. Small items are left in our vehicles most often (cell phones, cameras, small bags and sunglasses, in particular).</p>
						<p><strong>GRATUITIES:</strong> In many cases, shared-ride airport rates do not include a gratuity. Tipping is allowed and much appreciated by our drivers. In special instances where there are four (4) or more passengers in a single party, and on certain discounted fares, a 20% gratuity will be added (if you specified the group size appropriately on your reservation form – the 20% gratuity is already included.).</p>
						<p><strong>SMOKING:</strong> Smoking is not permitted in any of our vehicles.</p>
						<p><strong>TRAVELING WITH CHILDREN:</strong> Shuttle Express welcomes the opportunity to serve our younger travelers when accompanied by a responsible adult. State laws do not allow children to ride in the lap of an adult. Each child is considered a “passenger”. If your child is under the minimum age/weight standards, you must supply an approved car seat for each child to whom the applicable law applies. It is the parents’ or legal guardian’s responsibility to become knowledgeable about the applicable laws in the states in which they will be traveling. Operators reserve the right to refuse service to parties out of compliance with state laws.</p>
						<p><strong>USER ERROR:</strong> You, the passenger, are responsible for providing accurate information at the time of your booking. When you provide information for travel, you agree that the information will be accurate. Shuttle Express is not responsible for mistakes made by passengers while using the service, its official websites, or mobile applications. Confirmation emails are provided at the time of booking and allow customers to review the details of their reservation in advance of the reservation pick-up; allowing the passenger time to cancel or make any changes 72 hours or more in advance of the reservation, as required by the CANCELLATION POLICY outlined above.</p>
						<p><strong>CUSTOMER SERVICE CONCERNS:</strong> Customers are encouraged to notify us by email (info@shuttleexpressutah.com) of their experience, good or bad.</p>
						<p><strong>LIMITATIONS ON COMPENSATION FOLLOWING SERVICE FAILURE:</strong> Where it is determined to be company fault, customers may receive compensation in the form of partial or complete refund, reservation credits, or through other means. In most cases where alternative transportation is taken and paid for by the customer, reimbursement will not include full refund of the original reservation, but will reimburse the difference paid for the alternate mode of transportation over the original cost of the reservation with service. Please review the CANCELLATION POLICY, and RESERVATION ABANDONMENT sections outlined above.</p>
						<p><strong>LIMITATION ON COMPENSATION FOLLOWING MISSED FLIGHTS:</strong> When it is determined to be company fault, Shuttle Express may provide compensation not to exceed $200.00 per person for domestic flights and $300.00 per person for international flights. Shuttle Express may reimburse for overnight lodging in the event customer cannot book a flight out on the same day of travel. Reimbursement is based on the average standard room rate as dictated by management. Meals and other expenses are not covered as part of reimbursement for delays or missed flights. Shuttle Express does not assume any responsibility for lost income or potential income, or other losses resulting from missed professional or personal functions. When traveling to an important event, it is recommended to allow extra travel time by booking earlier than recommended times (particularly during seasons of potentially bad weather and road conditions) to avoid delays.</p>
						<p><strong>REFUNDS:</strong> Subject to the policies outlined above, once approved, a refund request is submitted within 5 days, excluding weekends and federal holidays. The refund is then completed by the customer’s financial institution. Customer should refer to their financial institution to check on status of refund. Please note that absolutely no refunds will be issued, for whatever reason, any-time after 120 days from the time your credit card was processed. By agreeing to these terms of service, you also confirm that you understand how our service works.</p>
